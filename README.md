# Hand Cursor
A simple but fun way to interact with your laptop using gestures like the Apple Vision Pro and other VR products.

## Features
- Move your hand to move the cursor
- Pinch with your thumb and index finger to left-click
- (WIP) other smart gestures like scrolling, zoom, and more
- (WIP) improved input smoothing to reduce jittering
- (WIP) allow for multiple hands to be tracked at once

## How It Works
We first feed in the video stream from the laptop's webcam using the `cv2` Python library. 

Using the stream, we can use Google's MediaPipe Hand Landmarker (`mediapipe` library) to identify the major landmark positions on a hand on the screen. Set ``showVideo = True`` in the main `hand-cursor.py` file to view the video feed with annotated landmarks.

We then map the positions from the video space to the laptop screen space, moving the cursor to the appropriate spot using ``pyautogui``. There is still some improvement to be made in this partâ€”the movement is a bit jittery, but creating minimum thresholds for movement can reduce responsiveness for the user.
